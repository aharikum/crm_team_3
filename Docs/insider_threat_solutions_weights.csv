1,Privileged Access & Session Recording (PAM),15,1500000,Highly effective at preventing privileged misuse and provides session-level evidence. Maps to repudiation concerns and authentication protection,https://www.cisa.gov/insider-threat-mitigation; https://www.cyberark.com/resources
2,Insider Risk & DLP,12,1600000,"Prevents unauthorized data exfiltration, a leading insider threat outcome. Maps to case where employee sold customer data used in fraud from 2011-2015 at JPMorgan Chase",https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/risk-management/insider-risk-management; https://www.broadcom.com/products/cybersecurity/information-protection/data-loss-prevention
3,SIEM + UEBA,11,2000000,"Detects behavioral anomalies and correlates user actions across systems. Directly relates to conscientiousness and neuroticism concerns. Even if someone if malicious, this software will help stop them from being successful",https://www.splunk.com/en_us/data-insider/what-is-user-and-entity-behavior-analytics.html; https://cloud.google.com/chronicle
4,Phishing-Resistant Authentication (AAL3/FIDO2),7,650000,"Eliminates credential sharing and phishing-based impersonation. Phishing is a big source of insider threat in organziations, and credential sharing enables others to pin malicious acitivity on other employees ",https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html; https://fidoalliance.org
5,Database Activity Monitoring (DAM),6,1050000,Monitors sensitive DB access and provides granular audit trails. This enables executives and security experts to monitor any suspicious activity to reduce the longevity of the attack and reduce impact,https://www.ibm.com/products/guardium-data-protection; https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/database-activity-monitoring-dam/
6,Immutable Audit Trail (WORM / Ledger),6,1000000,Prevents audit log tampering and supports non-repudiation. This is similar to how BitCoin has protections due to its ledger that prevent people from advertising fraudulent transactions to be mined,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html; https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-ledger/overview
